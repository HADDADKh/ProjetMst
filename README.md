#  Machine Learning for Emotional Behavior Recognition

The purpose of this article is to introduce a scenario to ubiquitous robots with cognitive capabilities to recognize the emotions, feelings, affects and moods of humans, in their context. This work presents an application based on feature extraction for facial expressions of different facial emotions (happy, sad, angry, fear, surprise, neutral, etc.). Humans are capable of producing thousands of facial actions during communication that vary in complexity, intensity, and meaning. But how to make today the robot know more reactions of a person. The objective of this paper is to show some results of the recognition of some emotional states (neutral, joy, sadness, surprise ...) after asking some questions.
